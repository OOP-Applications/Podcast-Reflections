# Podcast-Reflections
Reflections on the Image Changer Project. In this repository, you will find audio reflections, from the four groups and the instructor, regarding the project we just completed in OOP: Applications. You may wish to start with the instructor's reflection, as he gives an overview of the project, and the components inside the project.

A large part of this project was to experience being given code, not knowing how it was written, and having to come to an understanding of what's happening. Trying to interpret another's code, undocumented at that, is a challenge. The students successfully migrated the code from PyQt4 to PyQt5.

XML stands for extensible markup language. It is similar to HTML and was used for the .ui file.

PyQt is a graphical user interface (GUI) platform, for Python. The code we started with was in version 4, and the task was to migrate the code to version 5.
